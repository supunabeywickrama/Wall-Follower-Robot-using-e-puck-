# Wall Follower Robot using e-puck (Webots + Python)

This project implements a **left-wall-following robot** using the **e-puck robot** in **Webots**, controlled with **Python**.  
The robot autonomously navigates a maze by following the left wall using proximity sensors and differential drive control.
